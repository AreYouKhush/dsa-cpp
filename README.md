Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are crucial topics in technical interviews. The frequency of questions can vary, but here's a list of commonly asked DSA topics, ranked by their prevalence:

1. **Arrays**: Questions related to arrays are quite common. These may include finding pairs with a given sum, stock trading, and subarray problems.
2. **Linked Lists**: Expect questions about reversing linked lists, detecting cycles, merging sorted lists, and finding the middle element.
3. **Strings**: String manipulation problems are frequent. Examples include finding the longest substring without repeating characters and checking for anagrams.
4. **Binary Trees**: Topics like maximum depth, tree structure comparison, and inverting binary trees are often asked.
5. **Algorithms**: Algorithms like quicksort, radix sort, and other miscellaneous ones are part of interviews.
6. **Graphs**: Graph-related questions cover topics like traversals, shortest paths, and connectivity.
7. **Heaps**: Understanding heaps and their applications is essential.
8. **Dynamic Programming**: Expect questions on dynamic programming techniques.
9. **Bit Manipulations**: Solving problems using bitwise operations is another area of focus.
