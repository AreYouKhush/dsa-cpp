# Steps to solve a recursive problem

 1. What's the simplest possible input? ( Base Case )
 2. Play around with examples and visualize
 3. Relate hard cases to simpler cases
 4. Generalize the pattern
 5. Write code by combining recursive pattern with base case

# Recursive Problem Solving

 Let $f(n)$ be a recursive function
 1. Show $f(1)$ works (base case)
 2. Assume $f(n-1)$ works
 3. Show $f(n)$ works using $f(n-1)$
